# distance.py

Using the IDE terminal, or the command line, usage is as follows:

`distance.py` `[-h]` `[-n [N]]`

Using the `-h` argument provides a help message in the terminal

The optional `-n` argument takes an integer. If no argument is provided, the default length of `places.csv` is used. If an integer is provided, `N` random places from `places.csv` are selected for use.

The program then outputs the pairs of places and the corresponding air distance between all pairs. Finally, the average air distance and the pair with the distance closest to this average are given as output.
